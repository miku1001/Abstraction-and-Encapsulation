# OOP-Fan Class ‚úáüå´

***OOP Car Class*** is an Object-Oriented Programming(OOP) based that represents a fan. It allows you to model and interact with fan objects, 
incorporating important attributes such as speed, radius, color, and power status (on/off).

### Tech <a name="tech"></a>
**Object Oriented Programming** or **OOP** is a programming approach that focuses on objects. Objects are like building 
blocks that contain both data and actions. By using objects, we can make our code more organized, reusable, and easier to understand and maintain. 

Uses:
* [Python] - Programming Language

### Attributes <a name="att"></a>
- Speed: represents the current speed of the fan. It can have different values such as slow, medium, or fast, indicating the rotation speed
  of the fan blades.
- Radius: the radius of the fan. It determines the size of the fan and influences factors such as the airflow and coverage area.
- Power Status: indicates whether the fan is currently turned on or off.
- Color: represents the color of the fan.

### Project Structure <a name="proj"></a>
- FanClass.py: It handles the constructor, methods, and other parts that are necessary to run the program.
- TestFan.py: Program where the attributes such as speed, radius, power status, and color are found.

# OOP-Car Class üöó

***OOP Car Class*** is an Object-Oriented Programming(OOP) implementation that represents a car. It allows you to model and interact with car objects, 
incorporating important attributes such as the year model, make, and speed.

### Tech <a name="tech"></a>
**Object Oriented Programming** or **OOP** is a programming approach that focuses on objects. Objects are like building 
blocks that contain both data and actions. By using objects, we can make our code more organized, reusable, and easier to understand and maintain. 

Uses:
* [Python] - Programming Language

### Attributes <a name="att"></a>
- Model Year: The year model attribute in the CarClass refers to the specific year in which the car model was manufactured. It provides information
  about the age or vintage of the car, allowing you to identify the specific model year.
- Make: The make attribute in the CarClass represents the brand or manufacturer of the car. It specifies the company responsible for producing the
  vehicle and helps distinguish it from other car models on the market.
- Speed: The speed attribute in the CarClass indicates the current speed of the car. It enables you to track and control the car's velocity, making
  it possible to accelerate or decelerate the car as needed.

### Project Structure <a name="proj"></a>
- CarClass.py: It handles the constructor, methods, and other parts that are necessary to run the program.
- CarTest.py: Program where the attributes such as model year, make and speed interact.

### Run <a name="run"></a>
     $ git clone https://github.com/miku1001/Abstraction-and-Encapsulation.git
     $ cd Abstraction-and-Encapsulation
     $ python CarClass.py
     $ python CarTest.py
     
## How to run in IDE <a name="ide"></a>

To run this program, you need to:
1. Clone the repository from Github.

        $ git clone https://github.com/miku1001/Abstraction-and-Encapsulation.git
2. Open your preferred IDE software on your computer.
3. Import the program in your IDE by selecting the cloned repository as the program directory to import the code.
4. Run the program.
   
    **Usage**
    1. Enter the car's model year, make, and current speed.
    2. To increase the speed of the car by 5kph, use accelerate().
    3. To decrease the speed of the car by 5kph, use brake()
